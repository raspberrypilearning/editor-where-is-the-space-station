The International Space Station (ISS) is in orbit around Earth. It completes an orbit of the earth roughly every hour and a half, and travels at an average speed of 7.66 km per second. It’s fast!

Live data about the location of the ISS is published, and you can access the data via a web address, just like you would for a website.

**Test:** Run the starter code and you should see some data about  the International Space Station:
